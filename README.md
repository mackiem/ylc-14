Yelp Data Challenge Submission 2014

A restaurant's average rating and reviews on Yelp in
uence customers to an incredible degree.
An extra half-star rating causes restaurants to sell out 19 percentage points (49%) more
frequently. Despite the impact on the restaurant's business, achieving a better overall
rating is not straightforward. A user may give only one star to the restaurant just because he
or she found the quality of service to be abysmal even though the food and the restaurant's
location were up to his or her standard. These facts may have been mentioned in the review
in detail but the final rating would just reflect the poor quality of service. The user rating
alone does not provide any additional details, and as a result, the restaurant may not be
able to understand which aspects create a negative impact on user experience. Another case
may be that a certain popular dish will make users give the restaurant ve star ratings, but
they would not be satised with another aspect of the restaurant such as the dessert. The
high user ratings may hide the fact that some aspects of the user experience was negative
and that the restaurant has room to improve. Traditional recommender systems usually use
only the aggregated ratings without considering the hidden factors in the preference of the
users and the properties of the restaurants. For the restaurant domain, this could mean
main cuisine, dessert, service, sta friendliness, knowledge of sta, location, ambience, price
and many more aspects. Without considering the ratings for individual aspects, it is likely
that the recommendation systems will give inaccurate predictions to restaurants as well as
users.

In this project, we aim to uncover hidden details about the users' preferences with respect
to restaurant properties. With this information, we can provide precise recommendations to
the restaurants regarding what aspects they should concentrate on to improve user experi-
ence. Since we are backed by more meaningful information about users' preferences we can
provide better recommendations to users as to which restaurants they would prefer and why.
To summarize, from the results of this project, we can answer the following questions: "what
does a particular user care about when dining from a restaurant?", "which aspect should
the restaurant improve in order to eectively increase the rating?", and "which restaurant
is the best for a particular user?"
